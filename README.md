# MNIST Digit Recognition
## 🚀 What the Project Does

This project is a web application that recognizes handwritten digits using a trained neural network model. The model is trained on the MNIST dataset and can accurately classify digits from 0 to 9 uploaded as images by the user.

## 💡 Why the Project Is Useful

- Demonstrates the application of deep learning in solving a classic computer vision task.
- Offers a simple and interactive interface for digit recognition.
- Helps learners and developers understand how to build and deploy ML models in real-world applications using tools like TensorFlow and Keras.

## 🛠️ How to Get Started

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone 
   cd mnist-digit-recognition
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the app**
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

4. **Use the app**
   - Upload an image of a handwritten digit (28x28 or similar).
   - See the predicted digit and confidence score instantly!
