In this UML diagram:

MNIST Dataset: Represents the dataset containing images and labels for training and testing. It provides methods for loading and preprocessing the data.

Neural Network Model: Represents the neural network model used for digit recognition. It includes methods for building, compiling, training, and predicting digits.

Streamlit Application: Represents the web application built using Streamlit for user interaction. It includes methods for processing uploaded images and displaying predictions.

The relationships between classes are represented as follows:

The MNIST Dataset class is composed of the Neural Network Model class, as the dataset is an integral part of the model.
The Neural Network Model class has an association with the Streamlit Application class, indicating that the model is used within the application for prediction.
This UML diagram provides a visual representation of the classes and their relationships in the MNIST Digit Recognition project, aiding in understanding the structure and interactions within the system.
